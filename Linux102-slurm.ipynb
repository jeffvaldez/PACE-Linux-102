    "PACEâ€™s Linux 102: Efficient Workflow with Command Line Utilities builds upon the Linux 101 content to demonstrate extended features to improve user knowledge and workflow using command line utilities in a Hands-On course. Topics covered include the use of built-in job control to manage multiple processes, filtering and stream-processing utilities for lightweight data processing, advanced I/O options, and data compression utilities. The content is focused on example usage, and is intended to provide a template for users to adopt in their own workflow. (Material developed by Aaron Jezghani, PhD)\n",

This is especially problematic for producer-consumer schemes, where two processes run simultaneously in separate shells and exchange data back and forth.

These variables use the static link (`-L<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_LIBRARY`), but when compiling, typically the dynamic link is passed to the compiler (`-l<NAME_OF_LIBRARY>`). If you are unsure of the name of the library (e.g. `fftw` versus `fftw3`), you can run `ldconfig -p | grep <LIBRARY_BASE_NAME>` to see if it is installed, and if so, what is the name of the library.\n",

The Makefile provides instructions, such as the compiler flags to be used and what libraries should be linked, meaning that you, the user, do not need to remember them each time. Additionally, if only part of the source code is changed, `make` will only build it and any subsequent portions, which improves workflow efficiency by reducing the time spent compiling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, usage is as simple as updating the <b>Makefile</b> to reflect the local software environment (if not in usual variables such as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `LIBRARY_PATH`, etc.) and running `make` (and `make install` if this will install the project somewhere else). If an error occurs, and the build needs to be restarted, simply run `make clean` to purge any problematic components."

    "- And reduced number of inodes, preventing issues with number of file/directory quotas\n",
    "- Smaller files can be transferred more quickly (for example, from network storage like on PACE)\n",
    "- Reduces data structure complexity, as multiple files can be compressed to a single archive\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off, however, is that CPU time must be spent packing/unpacking the data, which can impact performance. The trick is to find the right balance for individual needs - what may work for one problem might not be applicable for another.\n",

    "With regards to compression, there are two types of compression: lossy and lossless\n",

Common examples include JPEG, MP3, and MP4 files; more specialized examples for scientific research are SZ and ZFP.\n",
    "- <b>Lossless Compression</b> is slower and typically achieves lower compression ratios (50-75% is usual), but the files can be reconstructed exactly. Common examples include PNG, FLAC, and ZIP, however, domain specific tools such as GeCo for bioinformatics can improve both compression rate and ratio.\n",

The zip format used on Windows is also available on Linux, but for many reasons other compression utilities are preferred.

    "From the above table, it would seem that the only difference between `zip` and `gzip` is that the former can archive (compress multiple files at once) while the latter cannot. However, an important detail is that when `zip` is used to archive, each file is compressed individually - thus it cannot benefit from similarities between each file! In other words, compressing and archiving many similar files with `zip` will often result in lower efficiency than the same operation with `gzip`+`tar`!"
